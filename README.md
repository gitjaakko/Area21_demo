# Area21_demo
Mobile application demo project as a part of the Area21-project (https://area21-project.eu/) in Tampere. Created with React Native and Redux with thingsboard.io as back-end interface. People involved in this project: Jesse Rönkkö, Pietari Noeskoski, Jaakko Pullinen with Pekka Pöyry supervising.
Project was done between 05/2018-08/2018 with additions later done by Pietari Noeskoski. This project was done as a part of our internship at Tampere University of Applied Sciences.

The code is unfinished and probably will not work, this repository exists just as an exhibition of what I have been a part of.
Objective of the project was to create a demo of the application with as much utility as possible given the time frame and our skills.

This application should, when complete, provide the customer with the ability to monitor the water and electricity consumption of their apartment and provide incentives for them to optimize their consumption.
The app receives data from sensors installed to the customers apartment meters. In our case the sensors were installed to POAS (https://poas.fi/) apartment meters in Tampere.
We were successful in installing the sensors and sending sensible data to our back-end, we were also successful in receiving the data through thingsboard api and visualizing the data in our demo.
We were also successful in creating a login flow to our app using OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow (https://auth0.com/docs/flows/concepts/mobile-login-flow).
